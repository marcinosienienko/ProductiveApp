# Project Title

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Life Harmony is a mobile app leveraging artificial intelligence to personalize time management, productivity, rest, sleep, and physical activity, ensuring users achieve an optimal balance between professional and personal life. Through adaptive AI algorithms, the app dynamically adjusts schedules, responding to changing needs and unforeseen circumstances.


## Background

The challenge of managing time and maintaining productivity while also caring for physical and mental well-being is common in today's fast-paced life. Many struggle with balancing work obligations, educational pursuits, home responsibilities, and the need for rest and relaxation. The Life Harmony app addresses the following issues:

Difficulty in managing time and priorities,
Lack of balance between work and rest,
Difficulty in maintaining productivity while caring for health.
My personal motivation for creating this app comes from observing how many people around me (including myself) struggle with these challenges. This topic is important because time management and well-being directly impact life quality, health, and happiness.


## How is it used?

Users download the app to their mobile devices, where they initially go through an onboarding process, sharing their goals, preferences, typical daily schedule, and challenges. The app then analyzes this information and collects data through device sensors (e.g., physical activity, sleep cycles) and calendar integrations.

Based on the collected data, AI creates a personalized daily plan, including recommended breaks, productivity sessions, physical exercises, and time for rejuvenation. Users receive smart reminders and suggestions that help them maintain an optimal daily rhythm.



## Data sources and AI methods
Data comes from multiple sources, including users' mobile device sensors (e.g., pedometers, sleep monitors), online calendars, and user entries about water intake, diet, and mood. We also use open datasets on health and well-being for initial training of our AI models.

We employ machine learning methods, including neural networks for analyzing sleep and activity patterns, and optimization algorithms for planning and adjusting schedules. Natural Language Processing (NLP) facilitates more natural interaction with users.

## Challenges

The project does not solve problems related to the physical limitations of time, such as inflexible work hours or long commutes. Additionally, there are challenges in ensuring user data privacy and security. Ethical considerations also include the potential for excessive reliance on technology in managing daily life.

## What next?

The project could evolve by integrating with more health monitoring apps and devices, offering a more holistic approach to well-being. Developing AI algorithms towards greater personalization and precision in recommendations is another step forward. Advanced skills in AI, data analysis, and digital security will be required.
